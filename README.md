1. Manager will upload folder for the questions that you need to solve for this week.  
    This will be done by every Sunday, after our meeting.

2. On meeting we will discuss and check each other's answer for the question and give review.  
    After reviews the files will be merge to each branch.

3. After all people's PR is received, manager will merge each persons's branch into main branch.  
    Then all people can see other people's answer in main branch.

4. Before solving the next week's problem, fetch the folder structure from Domwis-IR/Coding_Step-up_Study.


## If you have problem?
Feel free to ask manager about git or any other problem as well~ðŸ˜˜ðŸ¥°
